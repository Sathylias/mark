#### What ?

Another command line tool that lets you move faster between different
directories. 

Just like 'fasd', 'autojump' & 'z', but much worse and incomplete..

#### How ?

- Move the markit script somewhere in your path
- Source the script from your favorite shell
    source $(which markit)

#### Why ?

I spend so much time 'cd'ing to the same directories, this will save me some
time. I only learned about much better alternative like 'fasd', 'autojump' & 'z'
after I had started to write this tool

Also, it was a great learning experience..
